# Architecture Overview

This repository contains the LogFiend consulting website. It is a Jekyll site using the Just the Docs theme, customized with our own components and CSS.

## Key concepts

- Static site generated by Jekyll
- Theme: Just the Docs (gem-based), customized via includes, layouts, and custom CSS
- Content lives under `docs/` and the homepage composition in `index.md`

## Important paths

- `index.md`: Home page that includes section partials
- `_includes/`:
  - `hero.html`, `problems.html`, `services.html`, `cta.html`: Home sections
  - `components/`: header, sidebar, breadcrumbs, etc.
  - `header.html`, `footer.html`, `head.html`: Shared chrome
- `_layouts/`:
  - `default.html`: Main page layout
- `assets/`:
  - `css/main.scss`: Design system and utility classes
  - `images/`: Logos and imagery
- `docs/`: Pages
  - `services.md`, `pricing.md`, `about.md`, `contact.md`
  - `privacy.md`, `terms.md`
  - `articles/`: Article pages and index

## How to change the look and feel

- Tokens and utilities: edit `assets/css/main.scss`
- Global chrome: `_includes/head.html`, `_includes/components/header.html`, `_includes/footer.html`
- Home design: `_includes/hero.html`, `_includes/problems.html`, `_includes/services.html`, `_includes/cta.html`
- Docs polish: use `.page-hero`, `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`, `.highlight`, and table styles

## Navigation and SEO

- `_config.yml` controls site title, description, color scheme, search, aux links, and SEO/social metadata
- Use frontmatter (`title`, `layout`, `nav_order`) to place pages in the sidebar

## Adding content

- Create new pages in `docs/` with frontmatter
- Reference pages using Liquid `{% link docs/<page>.md %}` for reliable links

## Local development

- Install: `bundle install`
- Serve: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Build: `bundle exec jekyll build`

## Testing changes

- After edits, run a build to catch Liquid or syntax issues
- Prefer screenshots or GIFs in PRs to show visual changes
