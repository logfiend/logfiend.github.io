# How the Audit Works

## Step 1: Discovery

We schedule meetings with engineers, review architecture diagrams, identify data source lists, inspect log components, and review ETL pipelines, and detection rule functions/logic.

## Step 2: Pipeline Mapping

We diagram the entire telemetry flow: ingestion → processing → storage → alerting.

## Step 3: Audit & Analysis

Using proprietary checks and custom tooling, we analyze for:

- Broken data pipeline components
- Anomalies in data trends
- Data exposure (PII/secrets)
- Misconfigurations
- Broken alerting logic
- Compliance risks (e.g., log retention)

## Step 4: Report Delivery

You receive a PDF and HTML report with detailed findings and a presentation deck.

## Step 5: Observability & Telemetry (Optional add-on)

We deploy an Observability solution or adopt an existing in-house technology to collect
metrics for you, create dashboards, and create alarms

## Step 6: Remediation (Optional add-on)

We can assist your team in fixing issues or validating improvements.
