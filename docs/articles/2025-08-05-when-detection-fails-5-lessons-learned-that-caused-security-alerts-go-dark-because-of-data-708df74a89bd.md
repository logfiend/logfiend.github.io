Silent failures in your EDR pipeline could be hiding real threats. In this post, we explore how detection engineers can adopt data engineering practices to monitor for gaps in log telemetry—before it’s too late.

- 🔍 Learn why log absence is just as dangerous as malicious presence
- ⚙️ Discover techniques to build observability into your pipeline
- 📊 Understand why detection engineering is becoming data engineering
